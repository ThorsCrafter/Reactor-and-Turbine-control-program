# [Discontinued] Reactor and Turbine control program

***Unfortunately, I had to discontinue this project as well as my YouTube Channel. I don't have the time to develop this program any further.
Additionally, I don't need this program myself anymore since I stopped playing Minecraft a while ago.
Since I started Version 3.0 some time ago, but since have not been able to finish it, the program is in a bad state.
If you enjoy programming and want to continue this project, I'd be happy to give you access to it. Just ask ;)
